 # Lines
 
 Here we use random number generation (0 or 1) to decide on the direction for a line.
 
 When you run the playground, it should look something like this (exact form will vary each time):
 
 ![example-lines](example-lines.png "Lines")
 
 ## Note
 
 The following two statements are required to make the playground run. Please do not remove.
